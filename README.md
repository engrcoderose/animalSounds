# animalSounds
# Project Description:
"Make it Sound" is a web-based application that allows users to trigger animal sounds by clicking on corresponding buttons. The project aims to provide an interactive and fun experience for users, particularly children, by associating each button with the sound of a specific animal.

# Key Features:

Interactive Buttons: The project features a set of colorful buttons on the web page. Each button represents a different animal.

Audio Playback: When a user clicks on a button, the project plays the corresponding animal sound. This enhances user engagement and creates an enjoyable experience.

Animations: Upon clicking a button, a CSS animation is applied to the button to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience.

Responsive Design: The project's layout and buttons are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page content.
CSS: Used for styling the buttons and adding animations.
JavaScript: Used to handle button clicks, play audio, and manage animations.
Audio Files: Sound files (e.g., dog.mp3, cat.mp3) are included to provide the animal sounds.

# Project Purpose:
The primary purpose of "Make it Sound" is entertainment and education. It can be used as a fun learning tool for children to associate animal names with their corresponding sounds. It can also serve as a simple web-based game to engage users of all ages.

Developer: The project was created by Rosas (engrcoderose).

Note: To enhance the project further, you can consider adding additional features such as volume control, more animals and sounds, or even educational information about each animal.
